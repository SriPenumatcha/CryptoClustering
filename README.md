# CryptoClustering


## Overview

CryptoClustering is a data analysis project aimed at clustering cryptocurrencies based on their market data using K-means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). 
The project identifies the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method and compares the clustering results from the original data and the PCA-transformed data.


## Technologies Used

**Python**: Programming language used for the analysis.

**Pandas**: Library for data manipulation and analysis.

**scikit-learn**: Machine learning library used for K-means clustering, PCA, and data scaling.

**hvPlot**: High-level plotting API for interactive visualizations.

**Jupyter Notebook**: Web-based interactive computing environment where the analysis is performed.


## Folder Structure 

The CryptoClustering Challenge consists of the following folders and files:

**Resources folder** - Contains the crypto_market_data.csv file.

**Crypto_Clustering.jpynb**   - The Jupyter Notebook file containing the analysis.
 
**CryptoClustering Challenge Screenshots.docx** - Document providing screenshots of the results.

**Readme.md**-Overview of the project.


## How to Use

1. Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine using the following command:

   git clone https://github.com/SriPenumatcha/CryptoClustering.git

2. Open the `Crypto_Clustering.jpynb` file using Jupyter Notebook.

3. Run each cell in the notebook to perform the analysis and view the clustering results.

4. Review the analysis findings and conclusions.
